## Menus
The Menus in UnderScratch refer to the widely popular FIGHT, ACT, ITEM and SPARE buttons at the bottom of the screen, and the individual menus they lead to (i.e.: the fight button leads to the fight menu, etc.).  

## Fighting
Currently, the only "fully" functional Menu Button is the FIGHT Button, and its menu.  
It is used to fight the enemy / enemies (go figure), however this is currently very rough, for more details, read [link].

### Fight Target
its the eye looking mf that appears when you attack and the reticle, whenver you hit an attack itl use the scratch text box to tell you how much damage you dealt, this will ofc change soon.
  
## Acting
Furthermore, the ACT button has had a bit of work put into it, you can get to the enemy select menu for the acts, and thats about it.

This will of course be updated in the Future.


## Battle Box
While the BattleBox Object isnt 100% for the Menus, it is used for them, so it will be discussed here.

The Battle Box is used as a container-  
who the fuck am i kididng, youve all played Undertale or Deltarune, you know what a fucking Battle box is.
the thing that changes shape during attacks and where the text is during your turn.

Currently the Battlebox is in 2 fixed states, though the Enemy Atack mode is planned to have customization options (customization as in to change its size when an attack starts, maybe even midway through).
