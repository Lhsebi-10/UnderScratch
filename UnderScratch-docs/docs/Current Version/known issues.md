- The Text is currently very, **very** buggy, i will try to fix this before the next alpha releases.
    - until then, please wait for the text to finish writing out before pressing a key to go into another menu and refrin from editing the flavour text displayed at the base menu (it will be empty)
- at times, pressing enter, y or z (any of the confirm buttons) will nto work, simply press it again, idk why this happens but i will fix it soon
- same goes with x or shift (cancel buttons)
- sometimes, when starting the project, the teext may be messed up, simply restart the game and the text should fix itsself, again, this is a text engine issue
- Blue and orange attacks dont work, i know this, i will fix it

If you find any other issues, please open an issue on the github, if i have read it, i will reply to you and edit this page.
